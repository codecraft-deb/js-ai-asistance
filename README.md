# AI Web App using Speech Recognition and Synthesis

A simple web application that combines **Speech Recognition** (speech-to-text) and **Speech Synthesis** (text-to-speech). This app greets the user based on the time of day and listens to their speech, transcribing it into text and displaying it on the webpage.

## Features

- **Speech Synthesis**: Greets the user with an audio message based on the current time of day (morning, afternoon, or evening).
- **Speech Recognition**: Converts speech input into text and displays the transcribed text on the webpage.
- **Multi-language Support**: Currently set to German (`de-DE`), but the language can be easily customized.

## Demo

Click the microphone button to trigger a time-based greeting and start speech recognition. Your speech will be transcribed and shown on the page.

## Installation
